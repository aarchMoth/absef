# aBSEF - aarchMoth Bash Sound Engine Framework
a sound driver written entirely in Bash.  

# About
this was born from a single question: "just how much can i do with pure Bash?"  
as it turns out, a lot.  
i was so wrapped up in making it work that i forgot to ask why i would even make it, but that's never stopped me.  

# Requirements
SoX - handles audio  
Zsh - floating point numbers
